Asocijacije is apparently a game in Serbia where you have to guess words (A, B,
C, etc.) based on the clues corresponding to that word (A1, A2, etc. for word A;
B1, B2, etc. for word B). When all words are guessed, they themselves turn into
clues for the the final words (Final 1 and 2).

My coworker came to the office with a playing bord for this game that they built
out of carton, with the words permanently written on it (meaning the game can
be only played once). Therefore I built this reusable one in about one hour.
